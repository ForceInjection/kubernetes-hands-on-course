Performance Metrics:
  Average Latency: 50ms
  P95 Latency: 200ms
  P99 Latency: 500ms
  Throughput: 100.00 pods/sec
  Failure Rate: 2.00%

Resource Analysis:
  cpu: 13.12%
  memory: 6.41%

Recommendations:
  1. {Performance High Optimize Scheduling Latency 95th percentile scheduling latency is above 100ms Consider tuning scheduler configuration or reducing plugin complexity Improved pod startup time and user experience}
  2. {Resource Optimization Medium Improve CPU Utilization Cluster CPU utilization is below 30% Consider consolidating workloads or scaling down cluster Reduced infrastructure costs}
